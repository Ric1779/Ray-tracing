# Ray Tracing in C++

The tutorial provides a comprehensive journey into the world of ray tracing, a rendering technique fundamental to computer graphics. Starting with the basics of geometric primitives like spheres and quadrilaterals, the tutorial guides the reader through the intricacies of ray-surface intersection, texture mapping, and the implementation of various material effects. It systematically introduces concepts like texture coordinates for spheres, Perlin noise for creating realistic textures, and the integration of lights into the ray-tracing framework to simulate complex lighting scenarios. The tutorial expands the capabilities of the ray tracer by introducing the Cornell Box, a foundational scene for testing light interactions between diffuse surfaces. Furthermore, it delves into advanced topics such as volumes, allowing the simulation of smoke, fog, and participating media.

The tutorial strikes a balance between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, providing code snippets and explanations that empower readers to build their own ray tracer. Each section builds upon the previous, offering a structured learning experience that covers geometric primitives, material properties, lighting, and atmospheric effects. Whether exploring the nuances of ray-plane intersection or demystifying the complexities of volumes, the tutorial equips readers with the knowledge and tools to create realistic computer-generated images through the fascinating lens of ray tracing.
